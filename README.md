# Viwi Server

This project implements the Volkswagen Infotainment Web Interface as published under [https://www.w3.org/Submission/2016/01/](https://www.w3.org/Submission/2016/01/).


### Prerequisites

This project uses Gulp and TypeScript which needs to be available globally, so please make them available via

```sh
$ npm install gulp typescript -g
```

To install the server's dependencies, run the following command

```sh
$ npm install
```


## Build it

To build the server, use

```sh
$ gulp build
```

## Test it

To run the server and test it, use

```sh
$ http_proxy='' gulp test
```

Please ensure that proxy settings are set appropriately for your environment.
Test specifications will always follow the `+.spec`form, i.e. source file named `myfile.ts` => test file named `myfile.spec.ts`.


## Develop it

To run a watch on the source file and trigger an automatic reload on file changes, use

```sh
$ gulp watch
```

# Run it

To run the server separately, use the cli

```
  $ node ./bin/cli.js -p 9999 -v 'error'
```

alternatively you can use

```
  $ npm start
```

after you `gulp build` it

ws.onopen = () => {
  ws.onmessage = (data) => {console.log(data)}

```


## Contribution
I welcome everyone to contribute to this repo. Let us build awesome software - together. In order to streamline contribution to this repo, some guidelines are described below.

### Tests
In order to maintain a maximum of software quality, **tests** are needed. Whenever you contribute, please make sure that appropriate tests are in place. Also contributing tests only is highly valuable for the project.

### Git Commit Guidelines

These rules are adopted from [the AngularJS commit conventions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QrDFcIiPjSLDn3EL15IJygNPiHORgU1_OOAqWjiDU5Y/).

#### Commit Message Format

Each commit message starts with a **type**, a **scope**, and a **subject**.

Below that, the commit message has a **body**.

- **type**: what type of change this commit contains.
- **scope**: what item of code this commit is changing.
- **subject**: a short description of the changes.
- **body** (optional): a more in-depth description of the changes

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
```

Examples:
```none
feat(ruler): add inches as well as centimeters
```

```none
fix(protractor): fix 90 degrees counting as 91 degrees
```

```none
refactor(pencil): use graphite instead of lead

Closes #640.

Graphite is a much more available resource than lead, so we use it to lower the price.
```

```none
fix(pen): use blue ink instead of red ink

BREAKING CHANGE: Pen now uses blue ink instead of red.

To migrate, change your code from the following:

`pen.draw('blue')`

To:

`pen.draw('red')`
```

Any line of the commit message should not be longer 100 characters. This allows the message to be easier
to read on github as well as in various git tools.

#### Type
Is recommended to be one of the below items. Only **feat** and **fix** show up in the changelog, in addition to breaking changes (see breaking changes section at bottom).

* **feat**: A new feature
* **fix**: A bug fix
* **docs**: Documentation only changes
* **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing
  semi-colons, etc)
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug or adds a feature
* **test**: Adding missing tests
* **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation
  generation

#### Scope
The scope could be anything specifying place of the commit change. Usually, the affected resource is named here.

#### Subject
The subject contains succinct description of the change:

* use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
* don't capitalize first letter
* no dot (.) at the end

#### Breaking Changes
Put **any breaking changes** with migration instructions in the commit body.

If there is a breaking change, put **BREAKING CHANGE:** in your commit body, and it will show up in the changelog.
